# SPOJ-problems
I embarked on the journey to solving competitive programming problems on SPOJ. This repository contains my solutions to SPOJ's classic problems and some algorithms I practised along the way from different platforms. And also implementations to some of the common data structures and algorithms while I dived into competitive programming.
