# SPOJ-problems
I embarked on the journey to solving competitive programming problems on SPOJ. This repository contains my solutions to SPOJ's classic problems. And also implementations to some of the common data structures and algorithms while I dived into competitive programming.

## Directory Structure
  1. ```DS_algo``` - random implementation of common data structures like linked lists, trees.
  2. ```SPOJ_solutions``` - Solutions to classic SPOJ problems.
